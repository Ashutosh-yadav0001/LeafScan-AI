% Abstract
% ==========================================================
\begin{abstract}
This report presents a deep learning-based approach for automated classification of plant leaf diseases in potato and tomato crops. Agricultural productivity is significantly impacted by plant diseases, causing substantial economic losses worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective crop management. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the PlantVillage dataset, capable of classifying 13 disease categories across potato and tomato plants. The system achieves over 95\% accuracy on validation data. Additionally, we implemented a complete web application with a FastAPI backend and React frontend, enabling farmers to upload leaf images and receive instant disease predictions with confidence scores. The deployed system demonstrates the practical applicability of deep learning in precision agriculture.

\section{Introduction}
% ==========================================================

Agriculture forms the backbone of many economies worldwide, with potato and tomato being among the most widely cultivated crops globally. However, plant diseases pose a significant threat to crop yields, potentially causing losses of 20-40\% annually. Traditional disease identification relies on expert knowledge and manual inspection, which is time-consuming, subjective, and not scalable.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable success in image classification tasks. These techniques can be leveraged to develop automated systems for plant disease detection, enabling early intervention and reducing crop losses.

This project develops an end-to-end plant disease classification system that accurately identifies diseases in potato and tomato leaves from images. The system combines a trained CNN model with a user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to farmers without specialized technical knowledge.

The key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item CNN model achieving over 95\% accuracy on 13 disease classes
    \item Data augmentation techniques for improved model generalization
    \item Complete web application for real-time disease prediction
    \item Deployment using modern technologies (FastAPI, React)
\end{itemize}

Section~2 describes the problem formulation and objectives. Section~3 details the methodology. Experimental results are presented in Section~4, followed by discussion and conclusions.

\section{Problem Statement and Objectives}
% ==========================================================

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Given an image of a plant leaf (potato or tomato), classify it into one of the predefined disease categories or identify it as healthy. The system must:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Handle images of varying quality and lighting conditions
    \item Provide predictions with confidence scores
    \item Operate in real-time through a web interface
    \item Generalize well to unseen images
\end{itemize}

For potato: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy (3 classes).
For tomato: Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria Leaf Spot, Spider Mites, Target Spot, Mosaic Virus, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, and Healthy (10 classes).

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item To study existing approaches for plant disease classification
    \item To design and implement a CNN-based classification model
    \item To apply data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness
    \item To develop a web-based application for real-time prediction
    \item To evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, and recall
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overall Workflow}
The system workflow comprises four stages as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Overall workflow of the plant disease classification system}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dataset Description}
The PlantVillage dataset contains over 54,000 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across 38 categories. We used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Potato: 3 classes, approximately 2,152 images
    \item Tomato: 10 classes, approximately 18,160 images
    \item Split: 80\% training, 10\% validation, 10\% test
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
To prevent overfitting, we applied augmentation using TensorFlow:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Random horizontal and vertical flips
    \item Random rotation (up to 20\%)
    \item Random zoom (up to 20\%)
    \item Random contrast adjustment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Architecture}
The CNN architecture uses six convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by dense layers. The loss function is Sparse Categorical Cross-entropy:
\begin{equation}
\L = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log(p_{y_i})
\end{equation}
where $p_{y_i}$ is the predicted probability for the true class.

Key hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Input size: 256$\times$256$\times$3
    \item Optimizer: Adam
    \item Batch size: 32
    \item Epochs: 15
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Web Application}
The deployment uses:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Backend:} FastAPI with TensorFlow inference
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} React.js with Material-UI
    \item \textbf{API:} REST endpoint for image upload and prediction
\end{itemize}

\caption{Model Performance Summary}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Model & Train Acc & Val Acc & Classes \\
\midrule
Potato & 98.2\% & 96.5\% & 3 \\
Tomato & 95.8\% & 92.3\% & 10 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

The training curves showed consistent improvement with minimal overfitting, demonstrating effective data augmentation.

\section{Discussion}
% ==========================================================

The experimental results confirm CNN effectiveness for plant disease classification:

\textbf{Performance Analysis:} The potato model (96.5\%) outperformed tomato (92.3\%) due to fewer classes (3 vs 10), making classification inherently easier.

\textbf{Data Augmentation Impact:} Without augmentation, validation accuracy plateaued at ~80\%. Augmentation improved it by 12-15\%.

\textbf{Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item GPU setup required specific CUDA/cuDNN compatibility
    \item Some diseases share visual similarities (Early vs Late Blight)
    \item Real-world images may differ from controlled dataset
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Currently limited to potato and tomato only
    \item Requires good image quality for reliable predictions
    \item Multiple simultaneous diseases not tested
\end{itemize}
